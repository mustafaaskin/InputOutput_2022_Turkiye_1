This is an experimental data file.

TurkStat released 2012 domestic input output table for Turkiye published in 2016.

For analysis purposes, we need current input output table.
I updated and projected the current IO table to 2022.

I added and shared all related files with versions in my github account.

I shared the methodology used in data set estimation at the Medium webpage. Link below:

I will change tables whenever needed.
