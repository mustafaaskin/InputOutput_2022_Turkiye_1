This is an experimental data file.

TurkStat released 2012 domestic input output table for Turkiye published in 2016.

For analysis purposes, we need current input output table.
I updated and projected the current IO table to 2022.

I shared it in github.

I will change tables whenever needed. This is the first version.

version 01: input_output_yurtici_2022_Turkiye_v01.xlsx

version 02: input_output_yurtici_2022_Turkiye_v02.xlsx
Some balancing error fixed. Source file contain non-zero values in cells with scientific notation which distort balance.
