This is an experimental data file.

TurkStat released 2012 domestic input output table for Turkiye published in 2016.

For analysis purposes, we need current input output table.
I updated and projected the current IO table to 2022.

I shared it in github.

Explanation of data set is in medium:

I will change tables whenever needed. This is the first version.

version 01: input_output_yurtici_2022_Turkiye_v01.xlsx

version 02: input_output_yurtici_2022_Turkiye_v02.xlsx
Some balancing error fixed. Source file contain non-zero values in cells with scientific notation which distort balance. 

version 03: input_output_yurtici_2022_Turkiye_v03.xlsx
Some sectors have greater stocks relative to other sectors. They have been fixed.
